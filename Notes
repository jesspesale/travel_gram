Modal.js

useEffect - front end listener
    listens to changes on the front end
everytime state changes it refires all code inside (including onAuthStateChange)

auth.onAuthStateChanged - a backend listener
    listends to changes on backed including:
        - login/ logout
        - new user 

The two work together - dont want use effect to get called everytime the user changes the username or something

So we add the unsubscribe function - return by onAuthStateChange
Then you return the unsubscribe 
    says if the useEffect fires again, perform some clean up actions
    before you refire the useEffect
it unsubscirbes the listener so it doesnt spam with a thousand changes before rerendering
